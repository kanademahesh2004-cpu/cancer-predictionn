Cancer Prediction Using KNN | Machine Learning + Streamlit

This project is a Cancer Prediction System built using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
It analyzes gene expression data (Gene One & Gene Two) and predicts whether cancer is present based on these features.

The project includes:
✅ Data Analysis
✅ KNN Model Training
✅ Model Saving using Pickle
✅ Streamlit Web App for live prediction
